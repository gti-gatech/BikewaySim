## 
1. Try and get a working version of everything before making further changes
1. After that, we can commit and the create a branch to modify the code further


## Map Matching
- Combine Map_Matching.ipynb and Step_0
- Figure out how to sort the interactive components from the scripted ones
- Process that can sort through the different match results to retrieve the best one found
- Current version keeps all the settings tested and then creates a new file for each setting tested. Not sure if there's a check for excluded links


## Impedance Calibration
- decide if certain parts of step_0 need to be placed in map_matching because it's unclear

## BikewaySim Framework
- figure out where the different network exports went
- script certain parts
- make maplibre dashboard style report for propel

## New module that focusses on aggregated statistics on links?



## In general,
Cut down on the number of notebooks where possible
Separate out QA/QC and visualizaation parts from the scripted stuff if possible
