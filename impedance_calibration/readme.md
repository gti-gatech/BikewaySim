# BikewaySim Impedance Calibration for GPS Traces
Run these notebooks after completing the map_matching module. Before calibration, we'll need to split the map matched data into a training and testing set with `test_training_sets.ipynb`. After that, open `impedance_calibration.ipynb`. This notebook servers as the template for creating different impedance functions to calibrate. Once calibrated, open `assess_calibration_results.ipynb` to compare the modeled routes against the chosen routes and to test the calibrated impedance function on the testing set.
