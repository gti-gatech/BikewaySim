# BikecyclingPlus Demo
This code was prepared for a BicyclingPlus meeting. See slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHrUJiC8SU9Rft-tl2OvWuoJ4_ib4WqdFuHVpmSXtLc/edit?usp=sharing 

Most of this code is from my dissertation. The main files needed are 'demo.ipynb', and 'demo.yml', and the data in the 'Data' folder. Normally, I don't include data files in a GitHub repository, but it should make it easier to run all the code in the the 'demo.ipynb' file.
